# Essential steps to set-up your System:
## Setting up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
### 1) Pycharm:
- PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for Python development.
- You can download PyCharm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows). There are two versions available i.e. Professional version and Community version (free).
- After successfully installing PyCharm, you need to add new environment variables. Setting environment variables for PyCharm can be done at system level or by using PyCharm run configuration.
- To set environment variables at the system level on Windows:
  - Go to, edit the system environment variables
  - Environment variables
  - Under user variables select Path
  - Click Edit
  - Click New
  - Add (C:\Users\omkar\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\ & C:\Users\omkar\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts)
  - Click Ok
  - Click Ok
  - Click Ok
- You can find path and version of Python using below commands

  - Go to, edit the system environment variables
  - Environment variables
  - Under sser variables select Path
  - Click Edit
  - Click New
  - Add (C:\Users\omkar\anaconda3\ & C:\Users\omkar\anaconda3\Scripts)
  - Click Ok
  - Click Ok
  - Click Ok

## Conda environment:
- Conda environment provides a way to isolate different projects, preventing conflicts between dependencies and package versions required by different projects.
- Creating a Conda environment is crucial for maintaining a clean, organized, and reproducible development environment. It helps manage dependencies, reduces conflicts, and enhances overall efficiency and reliability in Python projects.
- Environments allow you to manage specific versions of Python and other packages for a particular project. By specifying exact dependency versions, Conda environments make it easier to share code, enabling others to recreate the same environment without issues.
- Conda simplifies package management with a single tool for installing, updating, and removing packages, making it more user-friendly than manual dependency management.
- With Conda, you can easily switch between different Python versions for different projects, particularly beneficial for projects with specific Python version requirements.
- Use Conda prompt or Command promt or VS Code powershell (ctrl + `) for Conda operations.

## Version vontrol system (Git):
Remote repository is a repository on GitHub account, whereas local repository is repository in your local machine/computer.

__1) Git:__
- Git is a distributed version control system or tool that enables collaboration among multiple contributors by allowing them to work on the same project concurrently.
- It helps you manage and track changes in your code or project over time.
- Git can be used through the command line interface, but various GUI tools, such as GitKraken or GitHub Desktop, provide a visual interface for those who prefer not to use the command line interface. As a programmer its always good to use terminal.

__2) GitKraken:__
- GitKraken is a graphical user interface (GUI) for Git, providing a visual representation of your repositories. Visualizes branches, commits, and merges.

__3) Github dekstop:__
- Github dekstop is another graphical user interface (GUI) for Git, providing visual representations and simplifying common Git operations.

__4) SVN (Subversion):__
- SVN is a centralised version control system that helps software developers manage and track changes in their code over time.
- It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, keeping a history of modifications, and facilitating collaboration.

## Repository hosting services (GitHub): 
GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are online platforms where you can store, collaborate, and manage your code that uses Git as the version control system. While they share the fundamental purpose of hosting repositories, they may differ in additional features, integrations, and the overall development ecosystem they offer.

__1) GitHub:__
- GitHub is a web-based platform, owned by Microsoft, for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. It's like a cloud-based space to store and work on your code.
- It provides Git repository hosting, code collaboration, issue tracking, and integration with various development tools.
  
__2) GitLab:__
- GitLab is also a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories, similar to GitHub.
- It offers a complete DevOps platform, encompassing not only version control but also continuous integration and deployment (CICD).
- It provides Git repository hosting, continuous integration, deployment tools, code review, issue tracking, and moreâ€”all within a single platform.

__3) Bitbucket:__
- Bitbucket is also a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories, owned by Atlassian, similar to GitHub and GitLab.
- It provides Git repository hosting, code collaboration, integration with other Atlassian products (such as Jira), and support for both Git and Mercurial repositories.

## Authentication methods in git:
When connecting your local machine to a GitHub account or remote repository in Git, you need an authentication method. Here are several methods commonly used:

__1) HTTPS:__
- Utilizes a username and password or a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication but support for password authentication was removed in August 2021 so PAT is used for authentication..
- Easy to set up, but may require entering credentials again and again.

> Setting up Personal access token (PAT):
- GitHub settings > Developers settings > Personal access token > Token (classic) > Generate new token > Generate new token (classic) > enter your GitHub password > Confirm > Set expiry date for token > Select scope of token > Generate token.
- After that, use that token as a password during Git operations.

__2) GCM (Git Credential Managers):__
- Enhances authentication by caching credentials.
- One-time process, often requires logging in with a browser.

> Setting up Git Credential Managers (GCM):
- Install Git Credential Manager (Installed at the time of installing git bash ).
- If GCM is not installed, use command (git credential-manager install) 
- Log in with your credentials using a browser and your are done.

__3) SSH Keys:__
- Provides a more secure method for authentication.
- Requires generating an SSH key pair and adding the public key to your GitHub account.
- Enables secure communication via the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

> Setting up SSH keys:
- Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine using command (ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "omkarfadtare965@gmail.com" -f my_ssh_key)
- in above command rsa is type of encryption and 4096 is strength of encryption.
- Copy the public key (id_rsa.pub) to your GitHub account.
- Ensure the private key is kept secure on your local machine.
- Verify SSH Key Addition:
- Start the SSH agent: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
- Add SSH Key to the SSH Agent: ssh-add /path/to/private/key
- Verify the key is added: ssh-add -l
 - Add the SSH public key to your GitHub account.















__Authentication methods used in Git:__
When you first install git and try to clone or push github account or remote repo you will need an authetication method to connect ur terminal to your github account:

1) HTTPS:
2) SSH keys:
3) GCM (Git credential managers):
4) Persoal access tokens (PAT):

- When you write a code on your local machine and push it to the github account or remote repository, you need a method to connect your remote repo to your local machine.
- There are two ways you can connect your remote repository to your local machine either by HTTPS url or SSH url.

 When you are using git clone copied path for the first time then it will ask for you github username and password
 Support for password authentication was removed on aug 2021

 Setting up personal access token:
 settings > developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens(classic) > Generate new token > Generate new token (classic) > enter your github password > confirm > You can set expiry date to the token > select scope of token > generate token > copy 
 git clone copied path > username > paste personal access token in password 


 Setting up GCM:
 I have used GCM one time process log in with browser

 Setting up SSH keys:
 For SSH URL u will need to generate a SSH key pair first. SSH urls basically provides access to a git repo via SSH whihc is basically secure shell protocol.
 So as to use SSH u need to generate SSH key pair on ur computer and add to the public key to ur github account. 
 To create SSH key on ur local computer just write ssh-keygen -t rsa(type of encryption) -b 4096(strength of encryption) -C "email@example.com" < entire a file path where you want to store that key < you can optionally enter password or leave it blank < key generated 
 to search for key:
 ls -al ~/.ssh
.pub key is the ey that your are going to upload to your github interface .pub stands for public its called ur public key. that anycan see this key.
the key without extension is called the private keyand is the one that you have to kee secure on your local machine. 

How it works is that the public key you put on github and then evry time you want to connect to github or push your code on github or use ur acc via your local machine you use your private key to show github that you are the one who generated this public key.
It mean only this private key could have generated this public key. 

to print out the public key 
cat testkey.pub
copy the key
then go to github go to settings < SSH & GPG key < new SSH key < Give any title < paste key < add SSH key < enter github account password < COnfirm

To make sure that the local cli knows about the key you just generated 
Open Git Bash.
Start the SSH agent: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Add SSH Key to the SSH Agent: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa (If you used a different key file name, replace "id_rsa" with your specific private key filename.)
Verify that the SSH key is added by listing the identities stored by the agent: ssh-add -l
Add SSH Public Key to Git Hosting Service:
