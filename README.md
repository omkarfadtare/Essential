When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents that you can access. 

**Word** or __Word__ : Bold characters
* *Word* * : Italic character
~~word~~: Strikethrogh 
**This text is _extremely_ important**: Bold and nested italic
***All this text is important*** :All bold and italic
This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text: subscript
This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text: Superscript

You can quote text with  >
Quoting code `code`
To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
Syntax highlighting code
```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

# Essential steps to set-up your System:
## Setting up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
### 1) Pycharm:
- PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for Python development.
- You can download PyCharm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows). There are two versions available i.e. Professional version and Community version (free).
- After successfully installing PyCharm, you need to add new environment variables. Setting environment variables for PyCharm can be done at system level or by using PyCharm run configuration.
- To set environment variables at the system level on Windows:
  - Go to, edit the system environment variables
  - Environment variables
  - Under user variables select Path
  - Click Edit
  - Click New
  - Add (C:\Users\omkar\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\ & C:\Users\omkar\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts)
  - Click Ok
  - Click Ok
  - Click Ok
- You can find path and version of Python using below commands

## Conda environment:
- Conda environment provides a way to isolate different projects, preventing conflicts between dependencies and package versions required by different projects.
- Creating a Conda environment is crucial for maintaining a clean, organized, and reproducible development environment. It helps manage dependencies, reduces conflicts, and enhances overall efficiency and reliability in Python projects.
- Environments allow you to manage specific versions of Python and other packages for a particular project. By specifying exact dependency versions, Conda environments make it easier to share code, enabling others to recreate the same environment without issues.
- Conda simplifies package management with a single tool for installing, updating, and removing packages, making it more user-friendly than manual dependency management.
- With Conda, you can easily switch between different Python versions for different projects, particularly beneficial for projects with specific Python version requirements.
- Use Conda prompt or Command promt or VS Code powershell (ctrl + `) for Conda operations.

## Version control systems & Repository hosting services:
__Terminology:__
- Remote repository is a repository on GitHub account, whereas Local repository is repository in your local machine/computer.

### Version control systems:
__1) Git:__
- Git is a distributed version control system or tool that enables collaboration among multiple contributors by allowing them to work on the same project concurrently.
- It helps you manage and track changes in your code or project over time.
- Git can be used through the command line interface, but various GUI tools, such as GitKraken or GitHub Desktop, provide a visual interface for those who prefer not to use the command line interface, but as a programmer it's always a good practice to use terminal.

__2) GitKraken:__
- GitKraken is a graphical user interface (GUI) for Git, providing a visual representation of your repositories. Visualizes branches, commits, and merges.

__3) GitHub Dekstop:__
- GitHub Dekstop is another graphical user interface (GUI) for Git, providing visual representations and simplifying common Git operations.

__4) SVN (Subversion):__
- SVN is a centralised version control system that helps software developers manage and track changes in their code over time.
- It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, keeping a history of modifications, and facilitating collaboration.

### Repository hosting services: 
- GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are online platforms where you can store, collaborate, and manage your code that uses Git as the version control system. While they share the fundamental purpose of hosting repositories, they may differ in additional features, integrations, and the overall development ecosystem they offer.

__1) GitHub:__
- GitHub is a web-based platform, owned by Microsoft, for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. It's like a cloud-based space to store and work on your code.
- It provides Git repository hosting, code collaboration, issue tracking, and integration with various development tools.
  
__2) GitLab:__
- GitLab is also a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories, similar to GitHub.
- It offers a complete DevOps platform, encompassing not only version control but also continuous integration and deployment (CICD).
- It provides Git repository hosting, continuous integration, deployment tools, code review, issue tracking, and moreâ€”all within a single platform.

__3) Bitbucket:__
- Bitbucket is also a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories, owned by Atlassian, similar to GitHub and GitLab.
- It provides Git repository hosting, code collaboration, integration with other Atlassian products (such as Jira), and support for both Git and Mercurial repositories.

### Authentication methods in git:
- When connecting your local machine to a GitHub account or remote repository using Git, you need an authentication method. Here are several commonly used methods:

__1) HTTPS:__
- HTTPS authentication in Git uses username and password for authentication but GitHub deprecated password authentication for Git operations in August 2021.
- So it is recommended to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your account password.
- Easy to set up, but may require entering credentials again and again.

> Steps to generate PAT:
  - Go to GitHub settings
  - Developers settings
  - Personal access token
  - Token (classic)
  - Generate new token
  - Generate new token (classic)
  - Enter your GitHub password
  - Confirm
  - Set expiry date for token
  - Select scope of token
  - Generate token.
  - Use generated personal access token as a password during Git operations

__2) GCM (Git Credential Managers):__
- Enhances authentication by caching credentials.
- GCM is a one-time process, often requires logging in with a browser.
- By default, GCM is installed at the time of Git installation.
- If GCM is not installed in system you can download GCM from [here](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/releases) 

> Step to check whether GCM is installed or not using below command in Git Bash:
  - ```ruby
    git credential-manager-core --version
    ```
    
__3) SSH (Secure Shell) Keys:__
- SSH keys provides a more secure method for authentication.
- It requires generating an SSH key pair and adding the public key to your GitHub account.
- It enables secure communication via the SSH protocol.

> Steps to generate and set SSH key:
  - Open Git Bash and write below command:
  - ```ruby
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```
  - Specify location and name of the file to be saved
  - You can optionally set a passphrase for added security. Press Enter to skip or enter a passphrase when prompted.
  - SSH key will be generated and saved to the specified location
  - View SSH public key using below command:
  - ```ruby
    cat file_path.pub
    ```
  - Copy SSH public key
  - Add SSH private key to SSH Agent using below command:
  - ```ruby
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add E:/file_path
    ```
  - Add copied SSH public key to GitHub or Git hosting services, go to GitHub account
  - Settings
  - SSH and GPG keys
  - New SSH key
  - Give a title (just for your reference)
  - Paste SSH public key
  - Add SSH key
  - Enter Github password
  - Confirm

### Git commands:

- clone: Bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like github into a folder on your local machine
- add: track your files and changes in Git
- commit: save your files in git
- push: upload git commits to remote repo like github
- pull: download changes from remote repo to your local machine, the opposite of push

- new repo > repo name > create repo
- This is how you can see the commits you have made in your file:
